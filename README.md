We will import this data through an API call to the National Water Information System (NWIS) maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)using dataretrieval.nwis package for ground water level from 2012 to 2024. We will import the data for temperature and precipitation from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search from 2000-08-01 to 2024-08-01.
